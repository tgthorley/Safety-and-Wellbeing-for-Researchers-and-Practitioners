A group of over 40 professionals who have dedicated their careers to ending hate, bigotry, extremism and violence in its many forms created a set of Guidance for Safe and Inclusive Events.</p> <p>This resource has been made available for use by organizations, conferences, and events. It offers detailed information on what represents violations of the Code of Conduct, as well as responsibilities for event organizers, participating organizations, and bystanders. Please consider adopting or adapting this Code of Conduct for your events.</p> <p>Adapting or adopting a Code of Conduct is critical:</p> <ul> <li>Establishing Expectations: A code of conduct clarifies what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior, ensuring all participants understand the boundaries and norms of interaction. This fosters a safer and more welcoming environment for everyone involved.</li> <li>Promoting Inclusivity and Diversity: By explicitly stating values such as respect for diversity, inclusion, and zero tolerance for discrimination, a code of conduct encourages a diverse range of participants to feel valued and respected. This is essential for creating a supportive community where all feel welcome.</li> <li>Addressing Harassment and Misconduct: The code of conduct should clearly outline procedures for reporting harassment or misconduct. This empowers participants to speak up if they experience or witness inappropriate behavior, ensuring swift and appropriate action can be taken by organizers.</li> <li>Ensuring Professionalism: Researchers and practitioners often collaborate closely, either in person or virtually. A code of conduct reinforces professional conduct, maintaining focus on the primary goals of the gathering and promoting productive interactions.</li> <li>Enhancing Safety and Wellbeing: Feeling safe and respected is essential for participants' wellbeing. A code of conduct contributes to a supportive environment where researchers can focus on their work without distraction or concern for their personal safety.</li> <li>Setting a Positive Tone: Organizers can use the code of conduct to set a positive tone for the gathering, emphasizing shared values and goals. This encourages constructive engagement and contributes to a positive reputation for the event and the community as a whole.</li> </ul> <p>Developing a code of conduct involves input from organizers and ideally, consultation with participants to ensure it addresses relevant concerns and reflects community values. It should be prominently displayed, easily accessible, and communicated effectively to all attendees prior to and during the event. Regular reviews and updates based on feedback and evolving needs also help maintain its effectiveness over time. Consider consulting legal resources or professionals specializing in privacy and ethics, as codes of conduct may also need to comply with legal standards and ethical guidelines specific to your jurisdiction.</p> <p>Here are some resources and examples to aid developing a code of conduct for your events and communities:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Tech Conferences and Community Guidelines: Many tech conferences and communities publish their own code of conduct that can serve as a good starting point. Examples include the codes of conduct from conferences like DEF CON, Black Hat, TrustCon.</p> </li> <li> <p>Online Resources and Templates: Websites like theCitizen Code of Conduct offer templates and guidelines specifically tailored for communities and events as do Geek Feminism</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Care-frameworks-for-gatherings/#spaces-for-decompression","title":"Spaces for decompression","text":"<p>Creating spaces for decompression during events where challenging topics that can trigger trauma are discussed is crucial for the wellbeing of participants.

Doxxing involves the malicious act of publicly revealing personal information about an individual, such as their home address, phone number, family members' details, or other identifying information. For researchers, this exposure can lead to harassment, threats, or even physical harm from extremist groups or individuals opposed to their work. It can also result in professional repercussions, such as damage to reputation or career disruption. Researchers may become targets of doxxing campaigns as a means to intimidate, discredit, or silence their work, making it crucial for them to adopt stringent security measures to protect their personal information and maintain their safety online.</p> <p>There is lots of information about how to protect yourself from Doxxing and other coordinated harassment as well as how to respond if and when this happens:</p> <ul> <li>DHS - Resources for Individuals on the Threat Of Doxing</li> <li>Pen America - Explaining what is online abuse and the forms it can take</li> <li>Crash Override\u00a0 Network - tools for dealing with online abuse</li> <li>Digital First Aid - Step-by-step process for what to do in a wide variety of circumstances</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Researcher-Security-and-Safety/#additional-digital-resources","title":"Additional Digital Resources","text":"<ul> <li>VoxPol - Researcher Welfare 1: Privacy and Security</li> <li>Advice on how to stay secure online from the UK's National Cyber Security Centre</li> <li>NCSC - Cybersecurity for Individuals)</li> <li>Security in a Box</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Researcher-Security-and-Safety/#physical-safety-resources-for-practitioners","title":"Physical Safety Resources for Practitioners","text":"<p>Risks, Dangers, and Threat Models: Evaluating Security Analysis for Conflict Practitioners TODO: EXPAND THIS SECTION</p>"},{"location":"Safety-and-well-being-for-frontline-practitioners/","title":"Safety and well-being for frontline practitioners","text":"<p>The importance of further research to address the issues researchers and practitioners face everyday and provide an evidence base for the inspiring practices we all conduct cannot be overstated. Researchers and practitioners constantly engage with sensitive subjects and materials, where ethical dilemmas and safety concerns are paramount. Understanding how identity factors\u2014such as gender, race, and religion\u2014affect researcher safety, and how to navigate these factors responsibly, is essential for fostering inclusive and secure research environments. Moreover, meaningful engagement with victims/survivors of violence and terrorism requires nuanced approaches to avoid re-traumatization and exploitation, while promoting their empowerment and inclusion in eradicating hate based violence.</p> <p>Furthermore, the ethical inclusion and care of former extremists in research processes are critical for rehabilitation and societal reintegration, necessitating robust frameworks that balance transparency with privacy concerns. Equally important is advocating for legal protections and navigating the complexities of compensation and trauma management in safeguarding researchers' and practitioners\u2019 rights and wellbeing.</p> <p>We aim to advance knowledge, inform policy, and enhance practices that contribute to a safer, more inclusive society.
