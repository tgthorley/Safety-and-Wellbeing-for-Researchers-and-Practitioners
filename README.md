# Safety-and-Wellbeing-for-Researchers-and-Practitioners
A handbook for preventing and countering violent extremism online safely while protecting your wellbeing
## Intention and Purpose of Guide 
Welcome to this handbook on safety and wellbeing for researchers and practitioners preventing and countering violent extremism online. In the challenging landscape of this field, where researchers and practitioners grapple with risks to both psychological and physical safety, this guide aims to be an introduction to crucial aspects to ensure the security, safety, and resilience of individuals involved in such critical work.

The first section of the handbook “Safety and Wellbeing” frames the problems that researchers and practitioners face and then details the published, evidence-based approaches that have been established.

As this field is still developing, evidence is not available for all the approaches that researchers use. so this should be considered as a guide of inspiring practices to draw from. In addition, we have tried to identify and recognize gaps in the existing evidence base to inform future research.

This handbook was developed in consultation with the members of the Eradicate Hate Global Summit working group “Protecting the Protectors.” The working group was established in 2023 with the purpose of drawing on the lived experiences of P/CVE researchers and practitioners to fill gaps in the field related to understanding mental, physical, and digital well-being while undertaking P/CVE work.
