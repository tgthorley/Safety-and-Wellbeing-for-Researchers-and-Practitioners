### Require effective wellbeing support measures for researchers

Funders for work that will require research and exposure to graphic content or other work that risks secondary trauma should consider including language in grant applications making support for researchers for example:

>"To be eligible for this grant, applicants must demonstrate the implementation of effective wellbeing support measures for researchers. It is essential that the grantee prioritizes the mental, emotional, and physical wellbeing of their researchers, considering the potential risks of secondary or vicarious trauma resulting from exposure to harmful and graphic content. Ensuring a safe and supportive work environment is crucial for the sustainable and healthy engagement of researchers_and_to mitigate potential negative impacts on researchers' mental and emotional wellbeing.
>
>Examples of wellbeing support for researchers include:
>
>- Mental Health Resources: The grantee should provide access to mental health services, such as counseling or therapy, to support researchers in managing work-related stress, burnout, and emotional challenges. This could include partnerships with mental health professionals or providing resources for employees to seek external support.
>- Work-Life Balance: The grantee should encourage a healthy work-life balance for researchers. This may involve implementing flexible working hours, promoting breaks, and discouraging excessive overtime. Encouraging hobbies, self-care practices, and time off are important aspects of supporting wellbeing.
>- Training and Education: researchers should receive comprehensive training on topics such as stress management, resilience, and recognizing the signs of burnout. The grantee should provide ongoing education and resources to help researchers build coping mechanisms and develop skills to maintain their wellbeing.
>- Supportive Work Environment: The grantee should foster a supportive and inclusive work environment for researchers. This could include promoting open communication, providing opportunities for collaboration and peer support, and implementing policies against harassment or discrimination.
>- Physical Health Support: It is important to prioritize physical health alongside mental wellbeing. The grantee should provide resources for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, such as access to gym facilities, ergonomic workstations, or wellness programs that promote exercise, healthy eating, and regular medical check-ups.
>- Regular Check-ins and Feedback: The grantee should establish regular check-ins with researchers to monitor their wellbeing, provide support, and address any concerns. Encouraging open dialogue and feedback mechanisms can help identify areas where additional support may be needed.
>- Recognition and Rewards: Recognizing the efforts and achievements of researchers is crucial for their motivation and overall wellbeing. The grantee should establish mechanisms for acknowledging and rewarding their contributions, such as performance-based incentives, public recognition, or professional development opportunities.
>- _Note: The examples provided are not exhaustive, and the foundation/grantor may have specific requirements or preferences. Applicants should tailor their wellbeing support measures based on the needs of their researchers while aligning with the guidelines provided by the foundation._
