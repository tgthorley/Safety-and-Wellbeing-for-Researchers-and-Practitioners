## Codes of conduct

For both virtual and in-person gatherings of researchers and practitioners in this field, providing a clear and well-defined code of conduct is crucial. This document outlines expected behavior and sets a standard for professionalism, respect, and inclusivity within the community. Hereâ€™s why developing a code of conduct is important:

- **Establishing Expectations:** A code of conduct clarifies what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior, ensuring all participants understand the boundaries and norms of interaction. This fosters a safer and more welcoming environment for everyone involved.
- **Promoting Inclusivity and Diversity**: By explicitly stating values such as respect for diversity, inclusion, and zero tolerance for discrimination, a code of conduct encourages a diverse range of participants to feel valued and respected. This is essential for creating a supportive community where all feel welcome.
- **Addressing Harassment and Misconduct**: The code of conduct should clearly outline procedures for reporting harassment or misconduct. This empowers participants to speak up if they experience or witness inappropriate behavior, ensuring swift and appropriate action can be taken by organizers.
- **Ensuring Professionalism**: Researchers and practitioners often collaborate closely, either in person or virtually. A code of conduct reinforces professional conduct, maintaining focus on the primary goals of the gathering and promoting productive interactions.
- **Enhancing Safety and Wellbeing:** Feeling safe and respected is essential for participants' wellbeing. A code of conduct contributes to a supportive environment where researchers can focus on their work without distraction or concern for their personal safety.
- **Setting a Positive Tone:** Organizers can use the code of conduct to set a positive tone for the gathering, emphasizing shared values and goals. This encourages constructive engagement and contributes to a positive reputation for the event and the community as a whole.

Developing a code of conduct involves input from organizers and ideally, consultation with participants to ensure it addresses relevant concerns and reflects community values. It should be prominently displayed, easily accessible, and communicated effectively to all attendees prior to and during the event. Regular reviews and updates based on feedback and evolving needs also help maintain its effectiveness over time. Consider consulting legal resources or professionals specializing in privacy and ethics, as codes of conduct may also need to comply with legal standards and ethical guidelines specific to your jurisdiction.

Here are some resources and examples to aid developing a code of conduct for your events and communities:

1. **Tech Conferences and Community Guidelines**: Many tech conferences and communities publish their own code of conduct that can serve as a good starting point. Examples include the codes of conduct from conferences like [DEF CON, Black Hat](https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-code-of-conduct.html), [TrustCon](https://www.trustcon.net/trustcon2024/code-of-conduct).

2. **Online Resources and Templates**: Websites like the[ Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/) offer templates and guidelines specifically tailored for communities and events as do [Geek Feminism](https://geekfeminism.fandom.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment)

### Spaces for decompression

Creating spaces for decompression during events where challenging topics that can trigger trauma are discussed is crucial for the wellbeing of participants. Here are some effective organizations can employ:

- **Designated Break Areas** Allocate specific areas within the event venue (whether virtual or in-person) where participants can retreat for quiet reflection or relaxation. These areas should be equipped with comfortable seating and calming activities. Resources for setting up calming spaces can be found through mindfulness and relaxation guides such as those provided by [Mindful.org](https://www.mindful.org/).

- **Scheduled Breaks:** Incorporate regular breaks into the event schedule. Encourage participants to use this time for self-care activities such as walking, stretching, or mindfulness exercises. Resources for mindfulness exercises can be found on platforms like [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) and [Calm](https://www.calm.com/).

- **Mindfulness or Relaxation Sessions:** Offer optional sessions dedicated to mindfulness, meditation, or relaxation techniques. These sessions can help participants manage stress and process difficult emotions. Resources for mindfulness and meditation practices can be found on websites like [Greater Good in Action](https://ggia.berkeley.edu/) .

- **Peer Support Groups:** Organize small, voluntary peer support groups where participants can openly discuss their reactions to challenging topics in a supportive environment. These groups can provide validation, empathy, and shared coping strategies. Resources on setting up peer support groups can be found through organizations like [NAMI](https://www.nami.org/).

### Physical security considerations

When organizing in-person events such as conferences where researchers have been investigating potentially dangerous groups and individuals, it's essential to prioritize physical security to ensure the safety of all participants. Here are some considerations and measures organizers should consider:

- **Security Assessment:** Conduct a thorough security assessment using guidelines from organizations like the [International Association of Professional Security Consultants (IAPSC)](https://iapsc.org/rfp-portal/rfp-examples/)

- **Emergency Plans:** Develop emergency response plans. Templates and guides for emergency plans can be found on websites such as [Make A Plan | Ready.gov](https://www.ready.gov/plan)

- **Collaboration with Authorities:** Establish communication with local law enforcement.
