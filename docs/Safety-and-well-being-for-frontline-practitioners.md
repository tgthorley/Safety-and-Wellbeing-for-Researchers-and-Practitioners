The importance of further research to address the issues researchers and practitioners face everyday and provide an evidence base for the inspiring practices we all conduct cannot be overstated. Researchers and practitioners constantly engage with sensitive subjects and materials, where ethical dilemmas and safety concerns are paramount. Understanding how identity factors—such as gender, race, and religion—affect researcher safety, and how to navigate these factors responsibly, is essential for fostering inclusive and secure research environments. Moreover, meaningful engagement with victims/survivors of violence and terrorism requires nuanced approaches to avoid re-traumatization and exploitation, while promoting their empowerment and inclusion in eradicating hate based violence.

Furthermore, the ethical inclusion and care of former extremists in research processes are critical for rehabilitation and societal reintegration, necessitating robust frameworks that balance transparency with privacy concerns. Equally important is advocating for legal protections and navigating the complexities of compensation and trauma management in safeguarding researchers' and practitioners’ rights and wellbeing.

We aim to advance knowledge, inform policy, and enhance practices that contribute to a safer, more inclusive society. We highlight these research gaps with the hope that new frontiers in research and practice can, ensure ethical standards and practical solutions that benefit researchers, practitioners and the communities they serve.
