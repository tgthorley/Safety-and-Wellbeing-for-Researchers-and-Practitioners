## Framing the problem: Risks to psychological and physical safety when performing this work 
Researchers and practitioners working on online extremism and terrorism face unique risks. These include repeated exposure to graphic and traumatic content, such as thousands of videos or images created by ISIS and other violent extremist groups. Researchers and practitioners must also manage the potential of being attacked or targeted online and offline through doxxing, trolling, or material threats by the groups they are researching. These risks can be amplified depending on the identity factors of the researchers or practitioners. Engaging in research and implementing programs aimed at preventing violence and hate demands sustained commitment and resilience from individual researchers and practitioners. Many researchers navigate these endeavors with scarce resources and insufficient institutional recognition. This lack of support can contribute to burnout among individuals tackling these complex and emotionally taxing issues, exacerbated by repeated exposure to traumatic content and the constant threat of online and offline attacks from extremist groups. 

This section of the handbook collates the research conducted into these risks and seeks to frame the problems facing researchers and practitioners to spread awareness of the risks as a first step in supporting our community to manage the risks effectively.
